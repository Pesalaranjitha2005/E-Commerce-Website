## 🧩 How It Works

1. Products are dynamically loaded from a JavaScript array.
2. Users can click **Add to Cart** to store items.
3. Cart icon shows total items in the cart.
4. Clicking the cart toggles a sidebar with cart contents and total cost.
5. The **Checkout** button clears the cart and thanks the user.

## 🔧 Customization

To add more products, simply update the `products` array in `script.js`:

```javascript
{
  id: 4,
  name: "New Product",
  price: 59.99,
  img: "https://via.placeholder.com/200x150"
}
